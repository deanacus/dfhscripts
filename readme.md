Inspired by react-scripts and kcd-scripts, this is an attempt to set up my own scripts repo for the common configuration/scripts things I like to to in my projects. Primarily focussed on the front end for the time being, hopefully it will work out well for me.

Things it will one day include:

Test - A way to run jest with a standard config file
Lint - A way to run a eslint with a standard config file
Format - A way to run prettier with a standard config file
Build - A way to build projects in a standard way
Validate - A way to validate that everything works as expected in the above.
Pre-commit - A way to run the above scripts (excluding build) pre-commit
