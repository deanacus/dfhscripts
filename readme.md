  <p>Common scripts for keeping my projects nice</p>
</div>

Inspired by [`kcd-scripts`][kcd-scripts] and [`react-scripts`][react-scripts], I decided to create a
collection of preconfigured scripts to run in my projects to make it easier to manage things like
linting, testing and formatting.

Currently non-functional on Windows, due to some naÃ¯vetÃ© on my behalf when building it.

## Installation

This package is distributed via npm so it can be installed with your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @deanacus/dfhscripts
```

```bash
yarn add --dev @deanacus/dfhscripts
```

## Usage

This is purely a CLI tool, and is designed for you to use in your npm scripts, in much the same way
`create-react-app` uses [`react-scripts`][react-scripts].

It exposes a binary called `dfhscripts` for use in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "dfhscripts lint",
    "format": "dfhscripts format",
    "test": "dfhscripts test",
    "coverage": "dfhscripts coverage",
    "build": "dfhscripts build"
  }
}
```

## Available scripts

As it stands, there are 4 available scripts:

- lint - runs eslint
- test - runs jest in watch mode
- format - runs prettier
- coverage - runs jest and collects coverage
- build - runs a simple rollup config and puts a single file in the dist directory

Scripts I would like to expand upon:

- build - I'd like to make it smarter to detect what kind of package you're building and build that
  properly, including bin files or multiple files.

Eventually I would like to add scripts for:

- pre-commit hooks
- webpack build
- npm-publish
- github-publish

## Configuration

Configuration for each script can be completely overridden by providing configuration for the
underlying package in whatever way that package expects. If one of those exists, your configuration
will be used instead.

There is no method for merging configuration. This is something best left up to the user -
`dfhscripts` exposes its configuration, so that if you would like to do this, simple import the
relevent config and extend it.

## Contributions

I'd love to have contributions. This is a pretty simple project, and not exactly a lot of difficulty
coding, so perhaps it would be a good chance for someone to get their feet wet with contributing to
other people's code.

## Acknowledgements

Primarily, [Kent C. Dodds][kcd]. His [`kcd-scripts`][kcd-scripts] is pretty much the entire inspiration
for this package (and I've definitely borrowed heavily from his package's code), along with
[`react-scripts`][react-scripts]
